# `fulbo`

A little CLI utility to know what's going on with football. The reach of this
project is ongoing, but the basic feature set is:

- Display matches for the current day for the home team defined, the home league
  and configured leagues.
- Display the next matches from a given team.
- Display the standings for a given league.

## Donating

This project is possible thanks to the generosity of the people over at
[TheSportDB](www.thesportsdb.com), which allows us to query the information
necessary for this to work.
